This Payment Gateway For WooCommerce extends the functionality of WooCommerce to accept payments from credit/debit cards using the USAePay payment gateway. Since customers will be entering credit cards directly on your store you should sure that your checkout pages are protected by SSL.

[USAePay](https://www.usaepay.info/) Payment Gateway allows you to accept credit cards from all over the world on your websites and deposit funds automatically into your merchant bank account.

[WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) is one of the oldest and most powerful e-commerce solutions for WordPress. This platform is very widely supported in the WordPress community which makes it easy for even an entry level e-commerce entrepreneur to learn to use and modify.

* **Secure Credit Card Processing**: Securely process credit cards without redirecting your customers to the gateway website.
* **Refund via Dashboard**: Process full or partial refunds, directly from your WordPress dashboard! No need to search order in your USAePay account.
* **Authorize Now, Capture Later**: Optionally choose only to authorize transactions, and capture at a later date.
* **Restrict Card Types**: Optionally choose to restrict certain card types and the plugin will hide its icon and provide a proper error message on checkout.
* **Gateway Receipts**: Optionally choose to send receipts from your USAePay merchant account.
* **Logging**: Enable logging so you can debug issues that arise if any.
